# Summary
Discussions during the pre-summit hackathon and km-scale summit highlighted key scientific questions regarding process understanding and predictability that can be addressed in the km-scale climate model community. Those questions have been translated into hypotheses and experiments that guide the simulation structure for the next global km-scale hackathon. For more details, please refer to the [science statement](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/kQjQC3EAucoLp6O).

Three groups of simulations are planned:
 * **Idealized** -- Coordinated by Angel Peinado, Rosimar Rios-Berrios, and Allison Wing  
 * **DYAMOND-3, DYAMOND-4 and LES** -- Coordinated by Hans Segura and Daisuke Takasuka 
 * **Initialized** -- Coordinated by Pier Luigi Vidale and Andrew Gettelmann


# Simulations

## <span style="color:orange"> Idealized simulation

Two configurations are used in this category: radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) and aquaplanets.
1. **RCE**: Radiative-convective equilibrium simulations using global storm-resolving models have been conducted as part of the Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project (RCEMIP). See [Wing et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-793-2018) and [Wing et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020MS002138). While simulations have been conducted, climate models are welcome to provide new simulations following the RCEMIP protocol of its Phase II.
2. **Aquaplanets**: For the aquaplanets, the following protocol is required:
   * **Surface forcing**: Prescribed constant zonally symmetric sea-surface temperature (SST) QOBS without sea-ice interaction. Meridional SST gradient, with a maximum temperature of $27\degree\mathrm{C}$ at the equator and a minimum of $0\degree\mathrm{C}$ at $60\degree\mathrm{N/S}$.
   * **Radiation**: Perpetual equinox with a diurnal cycle. Well-mixed greenhouse gases and a constant zonally symmetric ozone profile corresponding to the mean climatology used in AMIP simulations.
   * **Spin-up**: 3 to 6 months by using a coarser aquaplanet atmospheric state.
   * **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: Time integration ($\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$) between 3 and 12 months.
   * **$\Delta{x}$**: Horizontal grid spacing ($\Delta{x}$) of 10 km, 5 km, and 2.5 km.
   * **$\Delta{z}$**: Vertical grid spacing (($\Delta{z}$)) is optional to each group.
   * **$\Delta{t}$**: Time step ($\Delta{t}$) is recommended to be similar across resolutions.
   * **P4K**: Simulation(s) with a constant forcing of +4 K in the SST profile need to be provided for every resolution.


## <span style="color:darkgreen"> DYAMOND-3: Control, P4K, and aerosol forcing


The protocol of DYAMOND-3 has been described in [Taksuka et al. (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40645-024-00668-1). The specifications are:
* **Configuration**: AMIP
* **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: From January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021.
* **$\Delta{x}$**: Less than 5km.
* **$\Delta{z}$**: Optional to each group.
* **$\Delta{t}$**: Optional to each group.
* **Initialization**: Atmosphere is initialized in January 2020. Both land and ocean initialization are up to each modelling group.
* **P4K**: Simulation with a constant forcing of +4K in the SST field needs to be provided
* **Aerosol forcing**: A simulation similar to the control by with pre-industrial aerosols is recommended.

Modelling groups have been started to finish DYAMOND-3 control and P4K simulations. Groups that want to contribute to the DYAMOND-3 protocol should contact Daisuke Takasuka.


## <span style="color:dodgerblue"> DYAMOND-4
The DYAMOND-4 protocol is the result of the discussion during the pre-summit hackathon and the global km-scale summit. The effects of resolution and coupling in representing weather phenomena are the center of these experiments. Three categories of simulations have been discussed.


1. **AMIP**: Global storm-resolving simulations are planned with the following specifications:
   * **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: From August 1, 2024, to September 31, 2024.
   * **$\Delta{x}$**: 2.5km, 5$\,$km, and 10$\,$km. As an option, a finer resolution can also be provided: 1$\,$km scale or finer (hectometer-scale)
   * **$\Delta{z}$**: Optional to each group.
   * **$\Delta{t}$**: Optional to each group. But recommended to be similar across resolutions.
   * **Initialization**: Atmosphere is initialized on August 1, 2024. Both land and ocean initialization are up to each modelling group.


2. **LES**: Modelling groups using large-eddy simulations are also welcome to contribute as a complement to storm-resolving models by running hectometer-scale simulations on regional domains. 
   * **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: From August 1, 2024, to September 31, 2024.
   * **$\Delta{x}$**: At least three different $\Delta{x}$, from 100m to 1$\,$km. An optional simulation with $\Delta{x}$ > 1$\,$km is also recommended.
   * **$\Delta{z}$**: Optional to each group.
   * **$\Delta{t}$**: Optional to each group. But recommended to be similar across resolutions.
   * **Initialization**: The atmosphere is initialized on August 1, 2024. Both land and ocean initialization are up to each modelling group.
   * **Domain**: It's recommended to use the ORCESTRA domain, following [Fiévet et al. (2026)](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.177315810.09022965/v2). Other domains and periods of time can be an alternative, but this would be accompanied by a set of observational data ("no reanalysis") that will facilitate the comparison.


3. **Coupled simulations**: Global coupled storm-resolving models are a complement to AMIP simulations. The specifications are:
   * **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: From August 1, 2024, to September 31, 2024.
   * **$\Delta{x}$**: 2.5km, 5$\,$km, and 10$\,$km in the atmosphere. $\Delta{x}$ in the ocean is the same across resolutions.
   * **$\Delta{z}$**: Optional to each group.
   * **$\Delta{t}$**: Optional to each group. But recommended to be similar across resolutions.
   * **Initialization**: Atmosphere is initialized on August 1, 2024. Both land and ocean initialization are up to each modelling group.
   * **Physics**: The model configuration should be similar to the AMIP simulation.
   
## <span style="color:lightgreen"> Initialized

There is strong interest in setting up 40-day simulations of the year 2026, in initialised mode, both atmosphere-only and coupled. Ideas will be
   * **$\int\Delta{t}\partial{t}$**: 12 chunks of 40 days for 2026.
   * **$\Delta{x}$**: < 5$\,$km in the atmosphere.
   * **$\Delta{z}$**: Optional to each group.
   * **$\Delta{t}$**: Optional to each group. 
   * **Initialization**: Atmosphere is initialized on the first day of each month starting in XXX. Both land and ocean initialization are up to each modelling group.
   * **Ensamble**: Up to each modelling group.
   * **Physics**: with and without convection parameterization
   * **Options**: specific case studies in hindcast mode, using the same framework, resolution hierarchies around particular months, chasing particular phenomena (and this could include regional downscaling), ECOMIP periods

# Individual Model Comments

## SCREAM
SCREAM has a control and SST+4K experiment to contribute. There is also a present and pre-industrial aerosol set. SCREAM is interested in doing some of the intialized hindcasts, and looking at the effects of resolution and deep convection. We may also have a regional (N. America) LES simulation at 500m or 200m to contribute.

## UM
The Met Office intend to provide two types of simulations. All at 5km horizontal resolution, using either COMORPH scale-aware convective parametrisation, or RAL3 physics (only shallow convective parametrisation)

* **40-day initialised several times per year, foscussing on the year 2026**
40-day Unified Model global simulations e.g. initialised on ~20th or 1st of each month. These can be linked to cover the entire year of 2026, but also run individually. There is interest in ensembles, so it is likely that certain months will be repeated several times.
* **Multi-year simulations** 
8-year global simulations, similar to DYAMOND-3, albeit running 2016-2024
